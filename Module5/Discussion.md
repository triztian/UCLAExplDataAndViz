**What are the impacts of using data to affect/or bring change inÂ society and advertisements?**

I think the impacts can be both positive and negative I believe there are 3 to aspects to consider for this kind of use of data.

First, the nature of the data collected; many data points related to a person or social group might be too invasive or of private nature such that the originator of the data might be unaware of it being collected and if aware they'd probably refrain from producing such data. Some data points that are health related might even fall under specific laws that protect the handling and use of such data.

The second aspect is the management of the data; this does not concern how it's used, but rather how it's stored, moved, stored after being 
transformed and more importantly how it's access is controlled (as accessed by internal and external actors)

The final aspect is how the data is used, if used to induce change or behavior that results in a healthier, better and with higher quality of life society. The other kind of impacts would be to mis-inform or to induce purchases of products, or decision making in a way that it only serves to extract money from consumers that don't really benefit them or that cause more problems in society or environment.

**What could be positive impacts, or more negative impacts of using such data?**

I think most of the positive impacts actually come from government projects (that is not to say that there are non-negative impacts), 
many of the government's use of data is usually for healthcare awareness or public support programs that are started or promoted in communities in which the data shows that are in need of such programs. Most definitively many of the negative aspects revolve around promoting consumer products or political views to highly susceptible individuals or communities, because for the most part access to data is available to those with the economic resources and that would benefit from influencing social behavior.
