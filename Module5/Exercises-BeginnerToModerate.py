#**********************
# Variables in Python
#**********************

#E1
# Declare a variable (i.e. something that stores a value) and initialize it (i.e. set something to that variable)

#E2
# Change the value of that variable (i.e. change what was initialized before), go ahead and try 
# to reset/declare, that variable a few times, check the variable type, (use type function, i.e. is 
# it int, string, etc.)
# Note: Run each variable declaration separately

#E3
# Global and local variables in functions (just run this and be able to describe the difference
# in variable states (i.e. one variable declaration ONLY exists in the function and the other)
# outside that function

def someFunction():
  someOtherVariable = "foobar"
  print(someOtherVariable)

someFunction()
print(someOtherVariable) 

del someVariable
print(someVariable)

#E4 
# Pass function to a function


#E5
#Now delete all the variables we made

#**********************
# Conditionals Python
#**********************

#E6
# Write a conditional in Python


#**********************
# Functions Python
#**********************

#E7
# Create a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with NO arguments,
# NO return values)

#E8
# Create a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# NO return values)

#E9
# Create a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# return values)

#E10
### Advanced
# Create a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# return values, has DEFAULT values and VARIABLE number of arguments)

#**********************
# Loops in Python
#**********************

#E11
# Create a while loop
  
#E12
# Create a for loop

#E13
### Advanced
# loop over a collection, use the enumerate() function to get index, and break and continue (generally)
# don't want to 'break' out of loops
  
### Advanced
#**********************
# Clases in Python
#**********************

#E14
# Declare 2 classes, and instantiate (declare one of each), and manipulate their variables
# Classes are the basis as a framework for object oriented programming
