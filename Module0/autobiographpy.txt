My name is _Tristian Azuara_ and I've been a software engineer for about 11 years
I'm originally from Tijuana, Mexico but I've lived in San Diego for the past 
10 years.

I studied Computer Engineering for a bit in Tijuana's local university, and 
have worked with _most_ of the traditional technologies in application development.

I've done Full Stack web development, front-end web development, mobile web 
development, native android and iOS development and in my current role I work
as a iOS Software Engineer for a Logistics company.

I've used Python mostly for automating development tasks such as code generation, 
data extraction and transformation, I've used SQL to prepare reports for Product
Managers and to guide product and feature development.

The company I work for internal hosts cross-department demos and just recently
a great data-driven solution to scheduling shifts was presented by a Senior 
Data Scientist, the project was great in terms of impact and how it was presented
to other departments; I hope to be able to learn or get started in some learning
some of the skills to come up with solutions in a way that my collegue did.
