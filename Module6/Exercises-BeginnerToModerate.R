#**********************
# Variables in R
#**********************

#E1
# Declare a variable (i.e. something that stores a value) and initialize it (i.e. set something to that variable)

#print the variables


#E2
# Change the value of that variable (i.e. change what was initialized before), go ahead and try 
# to reset/declare, that variable a few times, check the variable type, (use type function, i.e. is 
# it int, string, etc.)
# Note: Run each variable declaration separately


#(remember run each variable separately to see output)

# List/print objects

#E3
# Global vs. local variables in functions

# you should get Error: object 'a' not found is not defined' (variable ONLY exists in the function)


# This is the variable we declared earlier (it's GLOBAL)


#E4
#Now delete all the variables we made


#**********************
# Conditions in R
#**********************

#E5
# Write a switch statement in R


# Write an if/else statement in R


#**********************
# Functions in R
#**********************

#E6
# Define a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with NO arguments,
# NO return values)


#E7
# Define a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# NO return values)


#E8
# Define a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# return values)


#E9
### Advanced
# Define a function (i.e. takes inputs, outputs, in this case a function with arguments)
# return values, has DEFAULT values and VARIABLE number of arguments)

#**********************
# Loops in R
#**********************

#E10
# Create a while loop


### Advanced
#**********************
# Classes in R
#**********************

#E11
# Declare 1 class, and instantiate (declare one of each), and manipulate their variables
# Classes are the basis within object oriented programming
# R has an S3, S4 class
