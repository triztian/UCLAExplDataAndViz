Is it a Data Science problem?

A true data science problem may:
  * Categorize or group data
  * Identify patterns
  * Identify anomalies
  * Show correlations
  * Predict outcomes

A good data science problem should be specific and conclusive. For example:

  * As personal wealth increases, how do key health markers change?
  * Where in California do most people with heart disease live?

Conversely, a vague and unmeasurable problem may not be a good fit for a data 
science solution. For example:

  * What is the link between finances and health?
  * Are people in California healthier?
